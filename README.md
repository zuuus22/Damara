# Animated Portfolio Website

This is a modern, animated portfolio website built with **Next.js**, **Framer Motion**, and **GSAP**. The project showcases advanced UI/UX, smooth animations, and a beautiful, interactive design. I created this for people who want to take inspiration or clone it for their own needs.

## Features

- **Framer Motion** for smooth, declarative React animations
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** for scroll-based and advanced timeline animations
- **Glassmorphism** and modern UI design
- **Responsive** and mobile-friendly layout
- **Animated sections**: Hero, About, Skills, Projects, Testimonials, Contact
- **Custom cursor and parallax effects**
- **Beautiful tab switchers and animated indicators**
- **Interactive project cards with 3D tilt**
